In recent work on aeroelasticity simulations in the LSDO lab certain utilities and classes for aeroelastic coupling were copied from private repositories, with sometimes multiple copies appearing in the same Multidisciplinary Design Optimization (MDO) script. This repository serves as a centralized and standardized collection of these utilities. CSDL versions of these are available wherever necessary for applications.
